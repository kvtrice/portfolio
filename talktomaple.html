          <h4 class="sub-heading">Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Talk to Maple is a startup founded by myself and 2 other
            co-founders, with our idea being accepted into Antler’s VC
            pre-launch program in January 2023. This program offers promising
            founders the opportunity to build their companies and raise $200K in
            pre-seed funding.
            <br />
            As a co-founding team we built and launched a B2C app helping young
            people improve their mental health through building better self care
            habits, via the power of A.I. journaling and gamification.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Challenge -->
        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h4 class="sub-heading">The Challenge</h4>
          <h3>Make journaling an engaging experience</h3>
          <p>
            Journaling is widely accepted as a best practice tool to support
            mental health, however from our own experiences we've seen that many
            people simply don't do it. So we went on a mission to create a more
            fun and engaging experience, particularly for Gen-Z, the generation
            most in need of mental health support (with 1 in 5 impacted
            worldwide annually).
            <br /><br />
            I led product, design and front-end development and the other full
            time co-founder led go-to-market, commercials and back-end
            development. The third co-founder was part time (1-2 days a week),
            supporting the A.I. integration, prompt engineering and data
            science.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Goal -->
        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h4 class="sub-heading">The Goal</h4>
          <p>
            Our goal was to launch an app that included a journalling experience
            that users enjoyed and they wanted to keep coming back to (demand
            and engagement). We also wanted to prove that our journaling
            experience had a positive impact on the user, and that no harm was
            done.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Scope and Constraints -->
        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h4 class="sub-heading">Scope and Constraints</h4>
          <p>
            There were a number of constraints around this project. Being a VC
            program, we had an extremely short timeline with milestones we had
            to hit throughout to progress to the next phase. This meant at times
            we were making trade-offs between user needs and potential investor
            expectations.<br /><br />

            We also had no coding experience, so we decided to launch our app
            using a low-code platform. There was a steep learning curve and
            limitations to what we could achieve that had to be factored into
            the product and design decisions.<br /><br />

            We additionally had extremely limited budget, with any expense being
            out of pocket. Given this, we weren't able to outsource aspects of
            the project and ultimately kept costs low by doing / learning
            everything ourselves.

            <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p>
              I began discovery by outlining the key goals we had for this
              phase. In particular I wanted to understand:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                What currently works for young people when needing mental health
                support
              </li>
              <li>
                The competitive landscape including common design themes and any
                gaps in the market
              </li>
              <li>
                What others are saying around this issue online and elsewhere
                (mental health forums etc.)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
              We conducted user interviews and ran surveys targeting young
              people impacted by mental health to learn more. These activities
              helped us uncover some key insights:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Gen-Z care</strong> about supporting their mental
                health, and are happy to try new things to do so
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Talking</strong> was the most impactful activity that
                anecdotally helped when in need of support
              </li>
              <li>

            <h3>Researching the Competitors</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              For competitive analysis, I focussed on top-rated journaling apps,
              entertainment based mental health support apps (e.g. chatbots),
              mood trackers and digital self care companion apps.<br />
              This helped me identify <strong>common design patterns</strong> we
              can utilise and take inspiration from, as these will already be
              familiar to our users and will reduce friction and cognitive load.
              These included:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pre-set journal prompts, providing some guidance and direction
                for the user to get started
              </li>
              <li>
                A daily challenge or mission (+ rewards) to encourage users to
                return
              </li>
              <li>
                Utilising a WhatsApp style of messaging with chatbots, an easily
                recognisable and known format for users
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The analysis also helped me identify some promising
              <strong>opportunities</strong>
              for us to improve on the experience for users as well:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lack of A.I.</strong> - most mental health chatbots
                weren't powered by A.I., meaning the conversations were limited
                and it was pretty easy for a user to 'break' the experience by
                talking about something left of field.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Formal tone</strong> - The limited few that were powered
                by A.I. were very formal, lacked personality and felt forced or
                'fake'. It was very obvious it wasn't a real person you were
                speaking to.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Surface level</strong> - A number of apps claiming they
                supported journaling, actually only offered basic mood tracking
                features where the user is able to add their mood and then write
                a brief note about it. This doesn't go very deep and is unlikely
                to offer any significant benefits.

          <h3>Defining the scope of the MVP</h3>
          <p>
            To solve the problem at hand, we identified several key elements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile App</strong><br />
              Given our target market of Gen-Z, we wanted to offer something
              easily accessible to as many people as possible. With most people
              worldwide having a mobile in their pocket, a mobile application
              was the best way for us to do this.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>A.I. Powered Journaling</strong><br />
              We wanted to go beyond simple mood check-ins and provide an
              engaging experience. By leveraging AI and carefully crafting
              prompts, we believed we could achieve a fun and exciting
              journaling experience, while maintaining a conversational tone.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>WhatsApp Conversational Style</strong><br />
              Given the familiarity and popularity of the WhatsApp design style
              for conversations, we chose to adopt a similar interface for our
              mobile-based AI conversations.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Gamification</strong><br />
              Understanding that Gen-Z seeks entertainment, we decided to
              differentiate our app by gamifying the mental health experience.
              We aimed to create a Duolingo-like experience, as gamification not
              only promotes user retention but also helps establish long-term
              habits.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Digital Companion</strong><br />
              We observed the success and positive user feedback of mental
              health applications incorporating digital companions. We saw an
              opportunity to incorporate a self-care buddy into our app, which
              would guide our prompt engineering and provide a thematic
              structure for gamification elements such as items and missions.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            Despite our tight 4-week timeline for the first milestone, we
            believed we could achieve these features and demonstrate two crucial
            factors to potential investors. Firstly, our ability to build and
            launch a mobile application without a dedicated developer. Secondly
            this would provide enough end-to-end functionality for us to
            generate some meaningful user data to gauge early signals of usage
            and demand.<br /><br />
            I put together some basic wireframes to better visualise the
            direction of the solution given the above:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-image-block">

            alt="Conversational Style Wireframes"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Wireframes of the WhatsApp conversational style journaling approach
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <!-- Setbacks and revisions -->
        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h3>Setbacks, reflection and revising our approach</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            When we delved into building the WhatsApp conversational style
            feature, we hit a <strong>roadblock</strong>. We realised
            Flutterflow's messaging didn't support calling third-party APIs
            (e.g. OpenAI) and displaying the response. In order to do that we
            were going to need to write some custom code, which was outside of
            our capabilities.<br /><br />

            Initially this felt like a major setback; the whole premise of our
            app seemed to go down the drain without the conversational style
            journaling. Soon afterwards I was using Duolingo and had a
            <strong>lightbulb moment</strong>. They had this brilliant way of
            structuring lessons: one question per page, and you had to hit
            "submit" to move on. It kept you laser-focused on the task at hand
            and made everything feel doable, without overwhelming you with a
            wall of text.<br /><br />

            That got me thinking; what if we applied a similar approach to
            journaling? A step-by-step process, one page at a time. From a
            technical standpoint, we could handle the API response upon
            submission, and that solved our earlier woes. Plus, I had a hunch
            that it would actually provide a
            <strong>better experience</strong> for our users. More focus,
            bite-sized "missions," and less effort to complete a journal entry
            (which we discovered as a pain point in our user research).<br /><br />

            I put together some wireframes to outline this revised direction:

          <h3>Integrating the A.I</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            While integrating ChatGPT into our application, we considered the
            prompts and AI responses. Initially, we identified potential journal
            prompt areas based on our research. To validate and refine these
            prompts, we sought feedback from mental health professionals. After
            careful consideration, we settled on an initial set of prompts:

        <div class="project-text-block">
          <p>
            To gauge user engagement with the AI, we also
            <strong>conducted an experiment</strong> involving mental health
            professionals and users. The AI was hosted in a web browser, and we
            provided pre-set prompts from the perspective of our chosen digital
            companion; a puppy named Maple.<br /><br />

            From the experiment, we observed that users tended to
            <strong>disengage</strong> after approximately 4-5 exchanges. The
            key contributor being the AI's repetitive nature and excessive focus
            on asking "Why" repeatedly. This reinforced the decision to pursue a
            staged journaling approach instead of the WhatsApp conversational
            style. It also provided insights for improving our prompt
            engineering.<br /><br />

            Additionally, mental health professionals emphasised the importance
            of incorporating a <strong>red flag check</strong>. They stressed
            that if a user expresses self-harm or engages in extremely sensitive
            or harmful discussion, the AI needs to be able to recognise its
            limitations and provide appropriate resources.<br />

          <h3>Introducing a 'red flag' check</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ensuring ethical practices and prioritising the well-being of our
            users were key considerations throughout this process. To address
            this, we implemented a "red flag" system that allowed the AI to
            respond appropriately when users discussed serious issues like
            <strong>suicide and self-harm</strong>. In such cases we wanted to
            stop the conversation from going further and serve the user with
            some helpful resources for seeking help.<br /><br />

            Initially, we attempted to create our own capture system based on
            keywords, but we discovered that some instances slipped through
            undetected. Fortunately, OpenAI soon introduced their own
            auto-moderation feature, which captured most instances of concern.
            However, through QA testing we found there were still a few cases
            that went unnoticed.<br /><br />

            As a result, we decided on a <strong>combination approach</strong>.
            We utilised OpenAI's auto-moderation system alongside our dedicated
            keyword capture. This proved more effective and allowed us to
            continually build on the keyword list to address any potentially
            missed cases in the future. By combining these approaches, we were
            able to better ensure <strong>user safety</strong> while maintaining
            control over the moderation process.

              We spent 3 weeks defining, designing, building and launching the

            <p>
              During the initial days of our MVP launch, ChatGPT experienced
              frequent outages and errors. Users were often affected, receiving
              confusing error messages that deterred them from returning to the
              app. This created an overall poor user experience.<br />
              To address this issue, we added a fallback mechanism with a
              hardcoded message that aligned with the brand and companion. This
              approach seemed to have a positive impact on user retention; the
              inclusion of a message from the companion saying
              <em
                >"I'm just having a nap, puppies need their beauty sleep. Come
                back soon!"</em
              >
              actually encouraged 2 users to return to the app the following day
              asking Maple the companion <em>"Are you awake yet?"</em>. 🐶

            <h3>Valuable learnings from the MVP</h3>
            <p>
              The MVP provided some valuable feedback on ways to improve the
              experience to help improve engagement and retention:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Continued conversations</strong><br />
                Based on user data, we discovered that users wanted to continue
                their conversations with the AI by starting a new prompt but
                continuing from a previous completed entry. We also observed
                that users were typing out longer entries, indicating a desire
                for deeper engagement. These insights led us to the idea of
                introducing a 3-part journaling format instead of a single page.
                This approach allows users to have a more fulfilling
                conversation with the AI while still maintaining a staged
                approach. We considered the findings from our earlier
                experiment, which indicated that users tended to disengage after
                4-5 back-and-forths. By limiting the engagement to 3 parts, we
                aim to keep journaling exciting and engaging each time.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Improve accessibility</strong><br />
                Supervised user acceptance testing highlighted difficulties in
                distinguishing buttons, text fields, and other elements within
                the app. To address this, I implemented stronger borders and
                adjusted colours to enhance accessibility.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Tweak journal prompts</strong><br />
                Some users indicated that the single-word journal prompts were
                vague. To address this, we revised the prompts to use "I"
                statements that clearly convey what the user can expect from
                each prompt (e.g., "I want to reflect on something" instead of
                simply "Reflect").
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Increase visibility of system status</strong><br />
                We saw that users were unintentionally pressing the Submit
                button multiple times, leading to duplicated API calls and
                responses. We added notification text upon pressing the button,
                informing users of the slight delay, and disabled the button
                after the first press to prevent multiple submissions.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Submit button location</strong><br />
                Users were typing longer messages than anticipated, causing the
                text field to expand and push the UI at the top of the screen
                out of sight. To address this, I moved the submission button to
                the bottom of the text entry box, ensuring it remains visible to
                users immediately after they finish typing, eliminating the need
                for scrolling back up.

            <h3>The battle of the LLM's</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              During the process, a new release of ChatGPT occurred, which
              prompted us to assess whether we should switch our LLM or stick
              with the existing one, considering our focus on user
              experience.<br /><br />
              We initially utilised ChatGPT 3 DaVinci, as it was the latest
              version that allowed for fine-tuning and incorporating our own
              datasets. However, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo became available, promising
              better conversational prowess (without fine-tuning).<br /><br />
              After conducting internal testing, we discovered that ChatGPT 3.5
              Turbo generated more <strong>engaging</strong> and on-brand
              responses, exhibiting a conversational and personable tone.
              However, Turbo didn't strictly adhere to instructions during the
              final journaling stage, continuing the conversation indefinitely.
              On the other hand, DaVinci performed better in this aspect but was
              less effective in the earlier journaling stages, where we sought a
              more conversational approach with the ability to respond to
              multiple threads within a single response.<br /><br />
              To <strong>strike a balance</strong> between conversational
              engagement and summarisation, we decided to implement a hybrid
              approach. We used ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo for the first two parts of the
              journaling process and ChatGPT 3 DaVinci for the final part, which
              required a concise and summarised conversation.

            <h3>Understanding user sentiment</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              To gather feedback on user sentiment and evaluate the
              <strong>effectiveness</strong> of our journal prompts, we
              implemented a simple 3-point feedback scale. This allowed us to
              keep the feedback process easy to understand for the user, and
              remain fun, light-hearted and not feel like a chore following
              their journaling.<br /><br />
              We made the decision to have the feedback options be represented
              as
              <strong>emoji's</strong> - the Talk to Maple brand is fun and I
              wanted giving feedback to feel fun too. We also opted for a forced
              action, with the emoji selections becoming the only way to proceed
              to the rewards screen following their journal mission.<br /><br />
              Through researching other feedback mechanisms, I saw that this was
              a common design pattern, but given the change in UI to a key
              screen, we were prepared to revert the change if we saw any
              significant drop in journal completions following the launch of
              the next release.<br />

              This is great <strong>evidence</strong> that the combination of an
              improved journaling experience, UI and gamification really helped
              move the needle on user engagement. <br />
              Note: There is a slight dip in Day 0 retention for V1 versus the
              MVP. This can be attributed to changes made in the onboarding
              flow, in which the User was asked to do a full journal. This
              increased the speed they reached their 'Aha' moment, but also made
              it less likely to go to do an additional journal entry that same
              day.

          <!-- User Sentiment Results -->
          <div class="project-text-block">
            <h3>User sentiment in the right direction</h3>
            <p>
              Our results of our basic user sentiment analysis also showed that
              <strong
                >95% of journal sessions resulted in the user feeling either the
                same or better</strong
              >, with 38% recording better. This is a great early indicator to
              show that Talk to Maple isn't doing harm and in fact on the right
              path to boosting our users mood. Although to be sure there is
              still further work to do in this space. <br /><br />
              With the sentiment analysis being so simplified, it's difficult to
              understand if the high number of users reporting 'Same' is due to
              actually feeling the same, or if the other options of 'Better' or
              'Worse' are too broad or ambiguous that they don't fit what the
              user is actually feeling. Widening this to include a broader range
              of emotions or switching the format up would help us get a better
              gauge on this stat.<br />

              We had also included a short in-app feedback form for users to
              optionally complete, and we received some incredible feedback,
              reinforcing again that we were heading in the right direction:

              Whilst there have been positive early signals for Talk to Maple,
              there's definitely still a long way to go. Engagement and
              retention will continue to be the key focus metrics, which could
              be impacted through things such as:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Push Notifications</strong> - to remind users to
                complete their daily missions or journal entries to further
                optimise retention from Day 3 onwards.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>More Content</strong> - through introducing things like
                more journal prompts, better rewards, further customisation and
                more interactions with the companion. Further gamification
                through things like leaderboards and friendly competition to
                drive extrinsic motivation are also things we'd be looking to
                explore in the future.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Social Accountability</strong> - is a huge driver of
                habit formation; a great example is having a gym buddy. I
                hypothesise that introducing things like the ability to invite
                friends, send rewards to friends for completing a mission and
                supporting friends to stay accountable through in-app actions
                would help drive retention and engagement.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Further user sentiment analysis</strong> - in
                particular, against each journal prompt and see if there's a
                correlation between how people feel after journaling and which
                prompt they've chosen. This can help inform what kinds of
                prompts might be good additions (or even which should be
                removed)
              </li>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>
              As a team we had to opt out of the remainder of the program for
              personal reasons, however we will continue to work on Talk to
              Maple over time as a passion project.<br /><br />
              The Antler program was incredibly intense and high pressure, and
              there were so many learnings that came out of it, but one of the
              big ones would have to be how invaluable having the
              <strong>right data</strong> is. As a team we were data geeks (with
              one co-founder even being a data scientist by trade), so we took
              the time to track as many key metrics as we could from the get
              go.<br /><br />
              This definitely took a bit more time and effort, but turned out to
              be one of the best decisions we made. This helped not only build
              our credibility with the investment team but above all helped us
              make the <strong>best decisions possible</strong> for our app and
              our users.<br /><br />
              With such intense timelines we also had to prioritise our time;
              each day we focussed on the number one highest impact item we
              could be doing that takes us <strong>towards our goal</strong> of
              retained and engaged users. Having this clear north star helped us
              <strong>make trade-offs ruthlessly</strong> and move the needle as
              far as possible in the time we had. It did mean that other (also
              important) things got deprioritised in this early stage, such as
              marketing, acquisition etc.<br />
