          <h4 class="sub-heading">Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Talk to Maple is a startup founded by myself and 2 other
            co-founders, with our idea being accepted into Antlerâ€™s VC
            pre-launch program in January 2023. This program offers promising
            founders the opportunity to build their companies and raise $200K in
            pre-seed funding.
            <br />
            As a co-founding team we built and launched a B2C app helping young
            people improve their mental health through building better self care
            habits, via the power of A.I. journaling and gamification.

          <h3>Make journaling an engaging experience</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Journaling is widely accepted as a best practice tool to support
            mental health, however from our own experiences we've seen that many
            people simply don't do it. So we went on a mission to create a more
            fun and engaging experience, particularly for Gen-Z, the generation
            most in need of mental health support (with 1 in 5 impacted
            worldwide annually).
            <br /><br />
            I led product, design and front-end development and the other full
            time co-founder led go-to-market, commercials and back-end
            development. The third co-founder was part time (1-2 days a week),
            supporting the A.I. integration, prompt engineering and data
            science.

        <!-- Goal -->

          <h4 class="sub-heading">The Goal</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our goal was to launch an app that included a journalling experience
            that users enjoyed and they wanted to keep coming back to (demand
            and engagement). We also wanted to prove that our journaling
            experience had a positive impact on the user, and that no harm was
            done.

        <!-- Scope and Constraints -->
        <div class="scope-constraints">
          <h4 class="sub-heading">Scope and Constraints</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            There were a number of constraints around this project. Being a VC
            program, we had an extremely short timeline with milestones we had
            to hit throughout to progress to the next phase. This meant at times
            we were making trade-offs between user needs and potential investor
            expectations.<br /><br />

            We also had no coding experience, so we decided to launch our app
            using a low-code platform. There was a steep learning curve and
            limitations to what we could achieve that had to be factored into
            the product and design decisions.<br /><br />

            We additionally had extremely limited budget, with any expense being
            out of pocket. Given this, we weren't able to outsource aspects of
            the project and ultimately kept costs low by doing / learning
            everything ourselves.

            <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p>
              I began discovery by outlining the key goals we had for this
              phase. In particular I wanted to understand:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                What currently works for young people when needing mental health
                support
              </li>
              <li>
                The competitive landscape including common design themes and any
                gaps in the market

            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
              We conducted user interviews and ran surveys targeting young
              people impacted by mental health to learn more. These activities
              helped us uncover some key insights:

            <ul>
              <li>

                health, and are happy to try new things to do so
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Talking</strong> was the most impactful activity that
                anecdotally helped when in need of support

        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h3>Researching the Competitors</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            For competitive analysis, I focussed on top-rated journaling apps,
            entertainment based mental health support apps (e.g. chatbots), mood
            trackers and digital self care companion apps.<br />
            This helped me identify <strong>common design patterns</strong> we
            can utilise and take inspiration from, as these will already be
            familiar to our users and will reduce friction and cognitive load.
            These included:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pre-set journal prompts, providing some guidance and direction for
              the user to get started
            </li>
            <li>
              A daily challenge or mission (+ rewards) to encourage users to
              return
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilising a WhatsApp style of messaging with chatbots, an easily
              recognisable and known format for users
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            The analysis also helped me identify some promising
            <strong>opportunities</strong>
            for us to improve on the experience for users as well:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of A.I.</strong> - most mental health chatbots
              weren't powered by A.I., meaning the conversations were limited
              and it was pretty easy for a user to 'break' the experience by
              talking about something left of field.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Formal tone</strong> - The limited few that were powered
              by A.I. were very formal, lacked personality and felt forced or
              'fake'. It was very obvious it wasn't a real person you were
              speaking to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surface level</strong> - A number of apps claiming they
              supported journaling, actually only offered basic mood tracking
              features where the user is able to add their mood and then write a
              brief note about it. This doesn't go very deep and is unlikely to
              offer any significant benefits.

          <h3>Defining the scope of the MVP</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            To solve the problem at hand, we identified several key elements:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile App</strong><br />
              Given our target market of Gen-Z, we wanted to offer something
              easily accessible to as many people as possible. With most people
              worldwide having a mobile in their pocket, a mobile application
              was the best way for us to do this.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>A.I. Powered Journaling</strong><br />
              We wanted to go beyond simple mood check-ins and provide an
              engaging experience. By leveraging AI and carefully crafting
              prompts, we believed we could achieve a fun and exciting
              journaling experience, while maintaining a conversational tone.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>WhatsApp Conversational Style</strong><br />
              Given the familiarity and popularity of the WhatsApp design style
              for conversations, we chose to adopt a similar interface for our
              mobile-based AI conversations.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Gamification</strong><br />
              Understanding that Gen-Z seeks entertainment, we decided to
              differentiate our app by gamifying the mental health experience.
              We aimed to create a Duolingo-like experience, as gamification not
              only promotes user retention but also helps establish long-term
              habits.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Digital Companion</strong><br />
              We observed the success and positive user feedback of mental
              health applications incorporating digital companions. We saw an
              opportunity to incorporate a self-care buddy into our app, which
              would guide our prompt engineering and provide a thematic
              structure for gamification elements such as items and missions.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            Despite our tight 4-week timeline for the first milestone, we
            believed we could achieve these features and demonstrate two crucial
            factors to potential investors. Firstly, our ability to build and
            launch a mobile application without a dedicated developer. Secondly
            this would provide enough end-to-end functionality for us to
            generate some meaningful user data to gauge early signals of usage
            and demand.<br />
            I put together some basic wireframes to better visualise the
            direction of the solution given the above:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-image-block">

            src="images/projects/talktomaple/4_maple_wireframes1.jpg"
            alt="Conversational Style Wireframes"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Wireframes of the WhatsApp conversational style journaling approach
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <!-- Setbacks and revisions -->
        <div class="project-text-block">
          <h3>Setbacks, reflection and revising our approach</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            When we delved into building the WhatsApp conversational style
            feature, we hit a <strong>roadblock</strong>. We realised
            Flutterflow's messaging didn't support calling third-party APIs
            (e.g. OpenAI) and displaying the response. In order to do that we
            were going to need to write some custom code, which was outside of
            our capabilities.<br />

            Initially this felt like a major setback; the whole premise of our
            app seemed to go down the drain without the conversational style
            journaling. Soon afterwards I was using Duolingo and had a
            <strong>lightbulb moment</strong>. They had this brilliant way of
            structuring lessons: one question per page, and you had to hit
            "submit" to move on. It kept you laser-focused on the task at hand
            and made everything feel doable, without overwhelming you with a
            wall of text.<br />

            That got me thinking; what if we applied a similar approach to
            journaling? A step-by-step process, one page at a time. From a
            technical standpoint, we could handle the API response upon
            submission, and that solved our earlier woes. Plus, I had a hunch
            that it would actually provide a
            <strong>better experience</strong> for our users. More focus,
            bite-sized "missions," and less effort to complete a journal entry
            (which we discovered as a pain point in our user research).<br />

            I put together some wireframes to outline this revised direction:
