            AtOnce is an early stage start-up helping connect international
            students, service providers and education agents via an online
            marketplace. They had an existing platform built using a no-code
            tool which served as their MVP and were now seeking to uplift the
            platform and improve the user experience.

          <h4 class="sub-heading">The Challenge</h4>
          <h3>Improve the listing upload experience</h3>
          <p>
            The MVP to date had largely been designed by junior low-code
            developers with limited UX knowledge, leaving disparate features and
            usability issues throughout, ultimately resulting in users
            struggling to navigate the platform. Our brief was focussed on a key
            part of the user flow; to improve the user experience of a service
            provider uploading / advertising their services on the AtOnce
            platform.<br />

            This client project was completed as part of Academy Xi’s UX / UI
            Design Bootcamp. We worked in a team comprising 5 UX designers, and
            worked remotely across both Melbourne and Sydney.<br />

            We set up working norms as a team from the outset and each had
            area’s of the design process we were specifically responsible for,
            however everyone in the team was consulted and accountable at every
            stage throughout the process.

            <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>
              The team and I began discovery by outlining the key goals we had
              for this phase, which were to understand:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The wider problem space</li>
              <li>
                The needs and challenges of service providers when it comes to
                marketplace advertising
              </li>
              <li>How service providers partner with education agents</li>
              <li>
                How education agents refer their international students to
                service providers
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
              We conducted user interviews with both education agents and
              service providers to learn more. We also sat down with the AtOnce
              intern / development team to gain some insight into their
              learnings so far. These conversations led to us uncover some key
              insights that would later form the basis of our solution:
            </p>
            <p><u>Service Providers:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Uploading advertisements or listings is often a long,
                <strong>arduous</strong>
                process
              </li>
              <li>
                The ad needs to look <strong>attractive</strong> and include
                details that are specific to their particular service
              </li>
              <li>
                They want to see <strong>ROI</strong>. They want confidence
                their ad going to get them results.

            <p><u>Education Agents:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The agents’ <strong>reputation</strong> is on the line if they
                refer a students to a poor provider
              </li>
              <li>
                They need to <strong>compare</strong> multiple service providers
                against each other

              <li>

            <h3>Heuristics analysis of the current platform</h3>
            <p>
              Being a re-build project, we wanted to understand the current
              state of the platform and gauge some of the challenges our users
              might be facing from the existing implementation. As a team we
              conducted a heuristic analysis and some examples of what we found
              can be seen below:
            </p>

              The results of this confirmed our initial view based on feedback
              and the client kick-off meeting; there was plenty of room for
              improvement. With multiple usability issues found, we took this as
              a chance to highlight some quick wins for the AtOnce team. <br />
              At the mid-point of the project we held a client meeting and
              presented the results of our heuristic analysis. The client was
              impressed with our analysis and went on to implement some of our
              suggestions, later sharing back a video showcasing some of the
              changes they made based on our review.

            <h3>Learning from competitors</h3>
            <p>
              We also wanted to understand the current landscape of other
              marketplace platforms, to gain insight into the things they do
              well (or not so well) and to identify common design patterns and
              IA we can utilise, as these will already be familiar to our users
              and will reduce friction and cognitive load.<br /><br />
              We conducted competitor analyses into four different marketplaces,
              looking closely at the listing / advertisement upload flow and the
              design of the final listing. In particular we analysed Facebook
              Ads, Gumtree, Airbnb & Flatmates.<br /><br />
              This was a fruitful exercise, allowing us to come away with a
              clear understanding of some of the most common design patterns
              being used today in marketplace listings:<br />

          <h4 class="sub-heading">Define</h4>
          <h3>Reducing Scope</h3>
          <p>
            During our competitor research, we realised that the listing
            creation experience varied greatly depending on the category of the
            service you’re that you’re creating a listing for.<br /><br />

            Given our short project timeline it was going to be unrealistic for
            us to effectively address the listing needs for all of the service
            provider types that will be using the AtOnce platform. The decision
            was made to hone in on a single service provider type; accommodation
            providers.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h3>Why accommodation providers?</h3>
          <p>
            Accommodation is a non-negotiable for an international student
            arriving in Australia. Whilst student needs can vary widely, we can
            assume that close to everyone needs a place to stay when they move
            countries. We also hypothesised that due to the high value nature of
            the transaction (e.g. rent), there would be larger opportunity to
            capture revenue share from service providers (e.g. commission).
            <br /><br />

            Given these factors, we felt this was the highest value item for
            both the client and the users of the platform. With more time, we
            would have completed this UX process for each service provider type.

          <h3>Following the current user journey</h3>
          <p>
            Alongside our discovery research, it was important for us to
            empathise with the thoughts and feelings our users are going through
            based on the current experience. This can help us pinpoint where
            there are opportunities for improvement, and where we can turn a

              our users were facing - now we had to think about how to solve
              them! In order to do this we held a brainstorming session as a
              team, putting together multiple ‘how might we’ statements to
              re-frame the problems we’re aiming to solve and encourage
              creativity.

              our designs align with our users’ mental models. This was
              particularly important as we began thinking about the ordering,
              groupings and hierarchy of the content in the listing upload
              flow.<br /><br />
              After comparing similarities across participant results alongside

          <h3>Mapping out the user flow and wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Before jumping into design we mapped out the user flow of our users
            from the point they enter the platform to when their ad is
            successfully uploaded.<br /><br />

            With our proposed direction involving multiple screens, it was
            important that a user could go back to previous steps and even pause
            the process half way through if required. This prompted the
            introduction of a ‘save as draft’ workflow, and clarified the entry
            and exit points into the journey.

            We then put together some basic wireframes of our proposed solution,
            taking our defined features from the MVP matrix, the information
            architecture from the card sorting and the learnings from our
            competitor research. Our wireframes helped us get a better sense of
            the structure and hierarchy of our screens and be a final check on
            any potential gaps that may have been missed before moving on to
            prototyping.

            Confident with our design direction, we moved into designing the
            high-fidelity prototype that we would use to test with users. This
            included thinking through the specific selection option details and
            using AtOnce’s brand guidelines to produce a professional concept.

          <h3>Validating the designs</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted usability testing sessions with accommodation providers
            to validate whether the new designs would solve the challenges they
            face. We put together a scenario asking the user to create a new
            listing and observed how they interacted with the prototype.
            <br /><br />

            The feedback from the session was very positive, revealing that
            uploading a listing was much more straightforward and simple to do.
            The language was relevant and the fields and screens were easy to
            navigate for the users. However some needs were also highlighted:
          </p>
          <br />

            <li>
              Integration with third party review sources to reduce manual entry
              and potential bias

            <li>Tracking ROI on listings</li>

            <h3>A key takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              When comparing the information architecture of the existing
              platform to the solution we designed, it’s clear that the card
              sorting activity added a lot of value. Now we had information laid
              out in a way that users really understood and enjoyed based on the
              feedback.<br />
              The value of well research and thought out IA really can't be
              understated 👏
